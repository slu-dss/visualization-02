## Lesson Overview
This repository contains the second lesson for the Data Visualization in R seminar. This lesson explores how the structure of data influences visualizations.

### Objectives
At the end of this lesson, participants should be able to:

1. Recall key differences between `base` and `ggplot2` plotting
2. Construct scatter plots with loess fit lines
3. Generate paneled plots using faceting

### Lesson Resources
* The [`SETUP.md`](/references/SETUP.md) file in the [`references/`](/references) directory contains a list of packages required for this lesson
* The [`notebook/`](/notebook) directory contains an awesome markdown file for this lesson in both incomplete and complete versions
* The [lesson slides](https://slu-dss.github.io/visualization-02/) provide an overview of how the structure of data influences visualizations
* The [`references/`](/references) directory also contains other notes on changes to the repository, key topics, terms, data sources, and software.
